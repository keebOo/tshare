# install with homebrew

If you have ```homebrew``` on your MacOS/Linux, you can install ```tshare``` using a local formula:

```
HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API=1 brew install --build-from-source ./tshare.rb
```

You're done ðŸŽ‰ 

Run ```tshare -h```, star this repository and have fun. 

# build from source

_If you don't have homebrew_, you need a dlang compiler to compile tshare by yourself.

### install a dlang compiler
- Ubuntu: ```sudo apt install dub ldc libcurl-dev```
- macOS: ```brew install ldc dub```

*or* download a package from [here](https://dlang.org/download.html#dmd)

### compile tshare
```d
dub build tshare
cp tshare /usr/local/bin
```
